Differnces with 12.4

- Some loops are replace by a procedure using the function foverlaps.In 12.4 inly in row 98 this function is used. In V13 it is alos used in rows 167, 225, 412 and 463.
  These rows do represent the different approach used in 13 compared to 12.

- Also in 13 it is possible to add recurrent and not recurrent in 1 run. This was added because of a request but I would not use the function in this way myself.

- I added an extra sort because I was afraid that sorting was disturbed by data.table actions.I was not able to find proper documentation about the data.table package concerning which actions affect the order of the dataframe 
	See row 317, 324 in 13.7.
